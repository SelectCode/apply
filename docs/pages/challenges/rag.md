# RAG-based Meeting Improvement Challenge 🚀

## Context and Motivation 🌟

Welcome to the SelectCode RAG-based Meeting Improvement Challenge! 🎉 At SelectCode, we're facing a common corporate challenge: making technical knowledge more accessbible. We're turning to you, our innovative applicants, to help us address this using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.

## Challenge Description 📋

Your task is to design and implement a data pipeline that processes technical documentation and uses RAG to let people ask questions on how to perform some of these technical tasks.

## Technical Requirements 🛠️

- You will be provided with multiple guides in markdown format (realistic, imperfect output from a PDF extractor). You can find them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1St8ldgJHoP7CTIv7YMXmutnrWp0grlix).
  - You do not have to use all of these files. You can just choose the ones you like best.
- You have the freedom to choose your preferred programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
  - Focus on using RAG/LLM tools that are open-source or provide free API keys for evaluation, using paid service that might provide better output will not be an advantage.
- Your solution should demonstrate a well-designed data pipeline that incorporates RAG techniques.
  - You should pay attention to the classic RAG workflow like preprocessing the data if needed, generating embeddings, ingesting chunks into a vector database, etc.
  - Optional techniques that show domain knowledge are also appreciated (e.g. reranking of results)

## Core Functionality ✅

1. **File Processing**: Ability to ingest and process markdown guides.
2. **RAG Implementation**: Utilize RAG techniques to analyze and generate insights from the guides.
3. **Output Generation**: Produce some form of output that answers technical questions about the contents of the guides (e.g. how do I use branches in git?).

## Implementation Guidelines 📝

- Focus on creating a robust and scalable data pipeline.
- Your code should be of production quality. Pay attention to:
  - Clean, readable, and well-structured code organization
  - Appropriate commenting and documentation
  - Error handling and logging
- Consider best practices for data processing and RAG implementation.
- Be creative! We're interested in novel approaches to making meetings more efficient or enjoyable.

## Evaluation Criteria 🏆

We will evaluate your work based on the following:

- **Functional quality**: How well does your solution address the problem of improving meetings?
- **Code quality**: We're looking for clean, readable, and well-structured code.
- **Pipeline design**: How well-designed and scalable is your data processing pipeline?
- **RAG implementation**: How effectively have you utilized RAG techniques?
- **Documentation quality**: We're looking for a well-structured `README.md` file that explains your approach and how to use your solution.
- **Problem solving**: We want to see your thought process, so commit early and often with clear, informative commit messages.

## Submission 📤

- Provide your code in a public GitHub / GitLab repository.
- Include a README file that contains:
  - An overview of your solution's architecture
  - Installation and usage instructions
  - Explanation of your RAG implementation and how it addresses the challenge
  - Any assumptions you made and why
  - Ideas for future improvements or extensions of your solution
- If you've implemented any particularly unique or innovative features, please highlight them in your README. 🌟
- Send all this information via email to Stephan (stephan.le@selectcode.de).
