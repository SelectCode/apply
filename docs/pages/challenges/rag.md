# RAG-based Meeting Improvement Challenge 🚀

## Context and Motivation 🌟

Welcome to the SelectCode RAG-based Meeting Improvement Challenge! 🎉 At SelectCode, we're facing a common corporate challenge: too many meetings that are often less engaging than we'd like. We're turning to you, our innovative applicants, to help us address this using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.

## Challenge Description 📋

Your task is to design and implement a data pipeline that processes meeting transcripts and uses RAG to either make our meetings more efficient or more entertaining. You have the freedom to approach this challenge from either a practical or humorous angle - or both!

Here you can find the meeting transcripts: [Meetings transcripts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S7hJ5U6nGClbatBSZuaQpzsaA6Q2ElE3)

## Technical Requirements 🛠️

- You will be provided with 7 meeting transcripts in VTT format (output from MS Teams).
- You have the freedom to choose your preferred programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
- Your solution should demonstrate a well-designed data pipeline that incorporates RAG techniques.

## Core Functionality ✅

1. **Transcript Processing**: Ability to ingest and process VTT format transcripts.
2. **RAG Implementation**: Utilize RAG techniques to analyze and generate insights from the transcripts.
3. **Output Generation**: Produce some form of output that either helps save time in meetings or makes them more entertaining.

## Implementation Guidelines 📝

- Focus on creating a robust and scalable data pipeline.
- Your code should be of production quality. Pay attention to:
  - Clean, readable, and well-structured code organization 🧹
  - Appropriate commenting and documentation 📚
  - Error handling and logging 🚨
- Consider best practices for data processing and RAG implementation.
- Be creative! We're interested in novel approaches to making meetings more efficient or enjoyable.

## Evaluation Criteria 🏆

We will evaluate your work based on the following:

- **Functional quality**: How well does your solution address the problem of improving meetings?
- **Code quality**: We're looking for clean, readable, and well-structured code.
- **Pipeline design**: How well-designed and scalable is your data processing pipeline?
- **RAG implementation**: How effectively have you utilized RAG techniques?
- **Documentation quality**: We're looking for a well-structured `README.md` file that explains your approach and how to use your solution.
- **Problem solving**: We want to see your thought process, so commit early and often with clear, informative commit messages.

## Submission 📤

- Provide your code in a public GitHub repository. 🐙
- Include a README file that contains:
  - An overview of your solution's architecture 🏗️
  - Installation and usage instructions 🔧
  - Explanation of your RAG implementation and how it addresses the challenge 💡
  - Any assumptions you made and why 🤔
